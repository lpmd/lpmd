.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBLPMD\fR, Las Palmeras Molecular Dynamics, is a modular molecular dynamics simulation package, 
based completely on plugins. 
The \fBlpmd\-mixer\fR command reads atomic positions (and optionally velocities) from a data file, then combines them applying the selected mixers to them. It reads a \fIcontrol\-file\fR containing the description of the system being mixed and its parameters.
If the \fB\-p\fR option is given, no conversion is performed. Instead, \fBlpmd\-mixer\fR shows information about the intended use, current version, capabilities and parameters supported for a given plugin module.
.TP 
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increases the verbosity of the mixing process by one level
.TP 
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-option\fR
replaces all instances of $(\fIvariable\fR) by \fIvalue\fR in the \fIcontrol\-file\fR before running
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pluginhelp\fR
shows help about \fIplugin\-name\fR
.TP 
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
displays help and version information, and exits
.SH "CONTROL FILE FORMAT"
.PP 
The syntax of the control file format recognizes two kinds of elements, \fBone\-line statements\fR and \fBblocks\fR. 

.PP 
A one\-line statement has the structure:
.TP 
\fBstatement\fR [[\fIparameter\fR = ]\fIvalue\fR] [[\fIparameter\fR = ]\fIvalue\fR] [...]

.PP 
While a block has the following structure:
.TP 
\fBblock\-statement\fR \fIparameter\fR [OPTIONS]
.TP 
   \fIkeyword\fR \fIvalue\fR
.TP 
   \fIkeyword\fR \fIvalue\fR
   ...
.TP 
\fBend\-of\-block\-statement\fR
.SH "ONE-LINE STATEMENTS"
.PP 
Currently, the one\-line statements understood by \fBlpmd\-mixer\fR are: \fBset\fR, \fBcell\fR, 
\fBinput\fR, \fBplugindir\fR, \fBinclude\fR, \fBperiodic\fR, \fBprepare\fR, \fBcellmanager\fR, \fBpotential\fR, and \fBapply\fR.

.TP 
\fBset\fR \fIoption\-flag\fR \fIvalue\fR
.TP 
	sets the value of the global option \fIoption\-flag\fR to \fIvalue\fR  

.TP 
\fBcell\fR crystal \fIa\fR \fIb\fR \fIc\fR \fIalpha\fR \fIbeta\fR \fIgamma\fR
.TP 
	defines the geometry of the simulation cell using six crystallographic parameters

.TP 
\fBcell\fR vector \fIax\fR \fIay\fR \fIaz\fR \fIbx\fR \fIby\fR \fIbz\fR \fIcx\fR \fIcy\fR \fIcz\fR
.TP 
	defines the geometry of the simulation cell using three vectors, three components each

.TP 
\fBinput\fR \fImodule\fR \fIplugin\-option\-value\fR ... 
.TP 
	selects the plugin \fImodule\fR (which must be a CellGenerator plugin) for reading or constructing the initial positions (and optionally, velocities) of the atoms in the simulation cell. The parameters following \fImodule\fR are passed literally as options for the plugin

.TP 
\fBplugindir\fR \fIdir\fR
.TP 
	adds the directory \fIdir\fR to the plugin search path, so any additional plugins in that directory can be recognized by \fBlpmd\fR and loaded in a simulation

.TP 
\fBinclude\fR \fIinputfile\fR
.TP 
	includes the contents of file \fIinputfile\fR in the control file

.TP 
\fBperiodic\fR \fIx\fR \fIy\fR \fIz\fR
.TP 
	enables or disables periodic boundary conditions on the given axis. By default periodicity is enabled on all three axes

.TP 
\fBprepare\fR \fImodule\fR \fIplugin\-option\-value\fR ...
.TP 
	applies a SystemModifier plugin \fImodule\fR to the system before calculating properties. For example, one to set the initial temperature of the system, or to rescale the simulation box. The parameters following \fImodule\fR are passed literally as options for the plugin

.TP 
\fBcellmanager\fR \fImodule\fR
.TP 
	uses the CellManager plugin \fImodule\fR for handling calculations of neighbor distances

.TP 
\fBpotential\fR \fImodule\fR \fIa\fR \fIb\fR
.TP 
	assigns the Potential plugin \fImodule\fR to handle the interaction between the species \fIa\fR and \fIb\fR (denoted by atomic symbols, such as Cu or Ar)

.TP 
\fBapply\fR \fImodule\fR
.TP 
	adds the SystemModifier plugin \fImodule\fR to the list of modifiers that will be applied during the conversion 
.SH "BLOCK STATEMENTS"
.PP 
The only block\-statement understood by \fBlpmd\-mixer\fR is \fBuse\fR, which is used to load a plugin and specify its options.

.TP 
\fBuse\fR \fIplugin\fR [as \fIalias\fR]
.TP 
   \fIplugin\-option\fR \fIvalue\fR
.TP 
   \fIplugin\-option\fR \fIvalue\fR
.TP 
   ...
.TP 
\fBenduse\fR
