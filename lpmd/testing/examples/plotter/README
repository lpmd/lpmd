Overview
========

This is an external utility for lpmd, the goal is generate high-quiality render images
from a standard input file in lpmd format.

The intention is use lpvisual in order to determine the perpective and initial settings
for use lpmd-plotter.

Requirements
============

* povray
* mencoder (in order to make directly the movie)

Use
===

The lpmd-plotter executable use a control file as a argument. The control file contain
all the necessary information to make the rendering and the movie.

 lpmd-plotter input.control

You only need fill the input.control file with the necessary options.

Mandatory Options
=================

* input : Specify the file name in lpmd format.
          Example : input ../../output.lpmd

* antialias : true/false Specify the antialias for the renderization.
              Example : antialias true

* cameraLocation : Vector position from the camera. Take this value from lpvisual.
                   Example : cameraLocation <10.0,10.0,10.0>

* cameraLookat : Spacial position where the camera look. Take this value from lpvisual.
                 Example : cameraLookat <5.0,5.0,5.0>

* cameraUp : Rotation of the camera. Taken this value from lpvisual.
             Example : cameraUp <-0.005,0.001,0.999>

* camera : Define the type of camera, could be perspective or orthorombic.
           Example : camera perspective

* size : Size of the screen. Take this value from lpvisual.
         Example : size 640x480

* background : Color of the background of the image. In RGB vector format between 0-1.
               Example : background <1.0,1.0,1.0>

* radius : Size of the radius of the atoms. Usually between 0 and 2.
           Example : radius 0.8

Additional Options
==================

This is a set of additional options that you can use with lpmd-plotter.

* cameraLight : This have three different light modes in this version:
                * camera : Only ambientlight and an additional light with the camera.
                * medium : Default value, equal to camera more 4 lights.
                * higher : Equal to medium light but with additional 4 lights. Very
                           useful for rotateCamera and make movies.

* cameraRotate : This rotate the camera in order the png images are generated.
                 The rotation must be specify:
                 * Spatial point to look (around this the camera will rotate)
                 * Rotation vector (Vector of the direction of rotation). A recommended
                   value for this is the direction (look-pos) cross the up vector.
                 * Angle increase factor in each step. If is zero then is not increased.
                 Example : cameraRotate <15,15,15> <0.5,0.0,0.0> 0.1

* startframes : Set a number of initial frames with the initial configuration before
                the atoms start to move.
                Example : startframes 50

* finalframes : Set a number of final frames with the last configuration after the 
                atoms are totally freezing.
                Example : finalframes 50

* box : Set a box of the simulationcell. The parameters are the radius of the cylinder
        and finally the color of these.
        Example : box 0.1 <0.0,0.0,0.0>

* format : Specify the ouput format for the png and pov files. Used to set the number
           of decimals in the output. By default the format is movie%.4d
           Example : format pelicula%.3d

* povfiles : Delete or keep the povfiles generated during the process of rendering.
             Example : povfiles keep

* logo : Add a text logo in the final picture. You can set the position in the same way
         that the command convert (convert -list gravity).
         Example : logo NorthWest "My first video."

* movie : Generate an avi movie using mencoder. This is generated from the png files.
          You have to specify the number of frame per seconds, the name and the format
          of the image.
          Example : movie 12.0 final-movie.avi avi

Examples
========

-The first four examples take the same input file using different cameras and
 perspectives.
-The examples number 5,6,7 and 8 generate a movie from a small input file, using
 different parameters for lpmd-plotter.

ex1 : Take the values from lpvisual (Screenshot-1.png) and use this values in the 
      movie.control file. Using orthographic camera, and this example do not generate
      a avi movie. This example :
      * Use standard lights
      * Set a box
      * Keep the pov file
      * Add a textual logo

ex2 : Take the values from lpvisual (Screenshot-2.png) and use this values in the
      movie.control file. Using perspective camera, this example do not generate an avi
      movie. This example :
      * Use full lights
      * Set a box
      * Delete the pov files
      * Add a textual logo

ex3 : Take the values from lpvisual (Screenshot-3.png) and use this values in the
      movie.control file. Using orthographic camera, this example do not generate an avi
      movie. In this example :
      * Use antialias false
      * Change background color
      * Set a different image size. 912x856
      * Set logo in a different part.

ex4 : Take the values from lpvisual (Screenshot-4.png) and use this values in the
      movie.control file. Using ..... camera, this example do not generate an avi movie.
      In this example :
      * Use different format
      * Do not set a box
      * lower light

ex5 : Take values from lpvisual of a preliminar simulaiton (half.lpmd) of a thermal
      needle (examples/argon-thermalneedle.control) filtered using lpmd-converter
      'lpmd-converter -i lpmd:sphere.lpmd,start=0,end=-1,each=10 -o lpmd:file=half.lpmd,extra=rgb -u box:x=all,y=0-17.1,z=all -r'
      This example :
      * Take around 35 minutes.
      * Generate a movie 
      * Do not rotate the sample and do not add extra frames.
      * Use the format in order to define the ouput of the png files.

ex6 : Take values from lpvisual of a prelimunar simulations of a thermal needle 
      (same case that ex5).
      This example :
      * Take around 50 min.
      * Generate a movie.
      * Rotate the camera.
      * Add extra frames.
      * The frame per seconds is less, so the movie will be longer that ex5.
