Overview
========

This is an external utility for lpmd, the goal is generate high-quiality render images
from a standard input file in lpmd format.

The intention is use lpvisual in order to determine the perpective and initial settings,
after that we use that information in at lpmd-plotter.

IMPORANT NOTE : Sometimes the position of the camera, in the case of orthographic camera, 
should be changed by hand. We recommend displace in larger values the axis related to the 
view direction. For example, if camerapos is (1,1,1), we recommend try (1,1,10) if the
direction view is mostly in the Z axis.

Requirements
============

* povray
* mencoder (in order to make directly the movie)

Use
===

The lpmd-plotter executable use a control file as a argument. The control file contain
all the necessary information to make the rendering and the movie.

 lpmd-plotter input.control

You only need fill the input.control file with the necessary options.

Mandatory Options
=================

* input : Specify the file name in lpmd format.
          Example : input ../../output.lpmd

* antialias : true/false Specify the antialias for the renderization.
              Example : antialias true

* cameraLocation : Vector position from the camera. Take this value from lpvisual.
                   Example : cameraLocation <10.0,10.0,10.0>

* cameraLookat : Spacial position where the camera look. Take this value from lpvisual.
                 Example : cameraLookat <5.0,5.0,5.0>

* cameraUp : Rotation of the camera. Taken this value from lpvisual.
             Example : cameraUp <-0.005,0.001,0.999>

* camera : Define the type of camera, could be perspective or orthographic.
           Example : camera perspective

* size : Size of the screen. Take this value from lpvisual.
         Example : size 640x480

* background : Color of the background of the image. In RGB vector format between 0-1.
               Example : background <1.0,1.0,1.0>

* radius : Size of the radius of the atoms. Usually between 0 and 2.
           Example : radius 0.8

Additional Options
==================

This is a set of additional options that you can use with lpmd-plotter.

* warning     : This show/hide the warning messages, now only for messages related to light issues.
                * on : Show warning messages
                * off: Hide the warning messages
                Example : warning off 

* cameraLight : This is a number that indicate a factor for the 4 principal lights
                * The default value is the longer axes plus a 10%.
                * For highly asimetric box, set the value close the the small axis.
                * Try the option extraLight too to improve the image resolution.
                Example : cameraLight 25.0
* extraLight : Add extra light to the scene.
                * Are the same 5 front light by default plus 5 extra light in the back part of the scene.
                * back : is the only argument by the moment.
                Example : extraLight back

* cameraRotate : This rotate the camera in order the png images are generated.
                 The rotation must be specify:
                 * Spatial point to look (around this the camera will rotate)
                 * Rotation vector (Vector of the direction of rotation). A recommended
                   value for this is the direction (look-pos) cross the up vector.
                 * Angle increase factor in each step. If is zero then is not increased.
                 Example : cameraRotate <15,15,15> <0.5,0.0,0.0> 0.1

* startrotate : Frame which the figure will start the rotation process. By default the
                value is set to 1.
		Example : startrotate 35

* endrotate   : Frame which the figure will stop the rotation process. By default the rotation
                do not finish.
		Example : endrotate 60

* startframes : Set a number of initial frames with the initial configuration before
                the atoms start to move.
                Example : startframes 50

* finalframes : Set a number of final frames with the last configuration after the 
                atoms are totally freezing.
                Example : finalframes 50

* box : Set a box of the simulationcell. The parameters are the radius of the cylinder
        and finally the color of these.
        Example : box 0.1 <0.0,0.0,0.0>

* planeN : <N=1..6> Set the plane(s) to show in the image, you can set the color 
           and the level of transparency. Th planes are 1=xy;2=xz;3=yz;4=1+c;
           5=2+b;6=3+a. The level of transparency have to be a value between 0 and 100.
           Example : plane3 <0.5,0.0,0.0> 34

* format : Specify the ouput format for the png and pov files. Used to set the number
           of decimals in the output. By default the format is movie%.4d
           Example : format pelicula%.3d

* povfiles : Delete or keep the povfiles generated during the process of rendering.
             Example : povfiles keep

* logo : Add a text logo in the final picture. You can set the position in the same way
         that the command convert (convert -list gravity).
         Example : logo NorthWest "My first video."

* movie : Generate an avi movie using mencoder. This is generated from the png files.
          You have to specify the number of frame per seconds, the name and the format
          of the image.
          * For the case of gif animated output, the fps correspond of the time of the loop.
          Example : movie 12.0 final-movie.avi avi
          Example : movie 3.0 final-gif.gif gif

Examples
========

-The first four examples take the same input file using different cameras and
 perspectives.
-The examples number 5,6,7 and 8 generate a movie from a small input file, using
 different parameters for lpmd-plotter.

ex1 : Take the values from lpvisual (Screenshot-1.png) and use this values in the 
      movie.control file. Using orthographic camera, and this example do not generate
      a avi movie. This example :
      * Use standard lights
      * Set a box
      * Keep the pov file
      * Add a textual logo

ex2 : Take the values from lpvisual (Screenshot-2.png) and use this values in the
      movie.control file. Using perspective camera, this example do not generate an avi
      movie. This example :
      * Use full lights
      * Set a box
      * Delete the pov files
      * Add a textual logo

ex3 : Take the values from lpvisual (Screenshot-3.png) and use this values in the
      movie.control file. Using orthographic camera, this example do not generate an avi
      movie. In this example :
      * Use antialias false
      * Change background color
      * Set a different image size. 912x856
      * Set logo in a different part.

ex4 : Take the values from lpvisual (Screenshot-4.png) and use this values in the
      movie.control file. Using ..... camera, this example do not generate an avi movie.
      In this example :
      * Use different format
      * Do not set a box
      * lower light

ex5 : Take values from lpvisual of a preliminar simulation (half.lpmd) of a thermal
      needle (examples/argon-thermalneedle.control) filtered using lpmd-converter
      'lpmd-converter -i lpmd:sphere.lpmd,start=0,end=-1,each=10 -o lpmd:file=half.lpmd,extra=rgb -u box:x=all,y=0-17.1,z=all -r'
      This example :
      * Take around 35 minutes.
      * Generate a movie 
      * Do not rotate the sample and do not add extra frames.
      * Use the format in order to define the ouput of the png files.

ex6 : Take values from lpvisual of a prelimunar simulations of a thermal needle 
      (same case that ex5).
      This example :
      * Take around 50 min.
      * Generate a movie.
      * Rotate the camera.
      * Add extra frames.
      * The frame per seconds is less, so the movie will be longer that ex5.

ex7 : Take a voronoi nanostructure generated using the voronoi plugin. The idea is rotate the image in 360 degrees. 
      Is useful to generate animated gif for online images.
      * Take around 4-10 min.
      * Generate a gif using convert.
      * Rotate the camera.
      * Is only one frame.

ex8 : Take a surface of TiO2 in lpmd format. Is a single file, with only one 
      atomic configuration. However the goal is make a single movie with this.
      * Take arount 10 min,
      * Generate a avi video
      * Rotate the camera.
      * This use startrotate and endrotate variables.

logo : Generate the lpmd logo using lpmd-plotter.
      * Color and B/W logo.
